# Electric-Vehicle-Power-Simulator
This is the final project I wrote for my Matlab class that involved interpreting and outputting real-time data. We took weather measurements (solar and wind) from different parts of the United States and built an EV simulator that implemented several different options. You can select a number of vehicles, the month of the year you're in (different months consume different amounts of power), a percentage of a certain type of energy you're using, and you can adjust the amount of cars on the road while the simulation is running. The simulation tells you when the power is nearing max capacity that the grid can provide and gives you the power output, power demanded, etc.
